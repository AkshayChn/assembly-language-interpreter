# Assembly Language Interpreter (ALI)

This is a Assembly Language Interpreter (ALI) for a Simple AssemblyLanguage (SAL). SAL's instruction set is specified in the table below.

| Instruction | Explanation | 
|-------------|-------------|
| DEC symbol  | Declares a symbolic variable consisting of alphabetical characters (e.g., abc). The variable is stored at an available location in data memory. |
| LDA symbol  | Loads 32-bit word at data memory address of symbol into the accumulator. |
| LDB symbol  |  Loads 32-bit word at data memory address symbol into B. |
| LDI value   | Loads the integer value into the accumulator register. The value could be negative. | 
| STR symbol  | Stores content of accumulator into data memory at address of symbol. | 
| XCH         | Exchanges the content registers A and B. |
| JMP number  | Transfers control to instruction at address number in program memory. |
| JZS number  | Transfers control to instruction at address number if the zero-result bit is set. |
| JVS number  | Transfers control to instruction at address number if the overflow bit is set. |
| ADD         | Adds the content of registers A and B. The sum is stored in A. The overflow and zero-result bits are set or cleared as needed. |
| HLT         | Terminates program execution. |


Note:
- `main()` is in the ali.cpp file.
- All instructions stored into the memory are printed in the beginning after parsing the file.

How to compile:
- Run `make`

How to run:
- Run the program with `./output`
- Enter the name of the file containing the SAL source.
- Use the command loop.
